            I'm a software developer and analyst who loves to build applications
            and perform data analysis. I'm passionate about technology and how
            it can be used to build things and solve problems. I mainly build
            software using TypeScript, Go and Python. My interests are building
            full-stack web applications, data analysis, machine learning, and
            test automation.
